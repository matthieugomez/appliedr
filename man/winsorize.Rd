\title{Winsorize a numeric vector}
\usage{
winsorize(x, probs = NULL, cutpoints = NULL,
  replace = c(cutpoints[1], cutpoints[2]), verbose = TRUE)

winsorise(x, probs = NULL, cutpoints = NULL,
  replace = c(cutpoints[1], cutpoints[2]), verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of values}

\item{probs}{A vector of probabilities that can be used instead of cutpoints. Quantiles are computed as the inverse of the empirical distribution function (type = 1)}

\item{cutpoints}{Cutpoints under and above which are defined outliers. Default is (median - five times interquartile range, median + five times interquartile range). Compared to bottom and top percentile, this takes into account the whole distribution of the vector.}

\item{replace}{Values by which outliers are replaced. Default to cutpoints. A frequent alternative is NA.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. Should the percentage of replaced values printed?}
